learnings

- xsl and css are the only ways to back xml with something that is processed in browsers from static files
- but there are many other processors that other clients have done other things with in the past. they're just not supported now.
- both xsl and css are limited, css more limited, but simpler, whereas xsl is just a little limited but would work for most simple usecases.

when we wanna make a new host, this could be very cool to use rather than html because it functions as a shared interface. ultimately, it'd be great if markdown also would allow this, or if we could pass a processor to the browser as a header.
